Description
===========

This cookbook provides common setup recipes, helper methods and attributes that describe an OpenStack deployment as part of the OpenStack reference deployment Chef for OpenStack.

Requirements
============

* Chef 0.10.0 or higher required (for Chef environment use).

Cookbooks
---------

The following cookbooks are dependencies:

* apt
* database

Attributes
==========

Please see the extensive inline documentation in `attributes/default.rb` for descriptions
of all the settable attributes for this cookbook.

Note that all attributes are in the `default["openstack"]` "namespace"

Recipes
=======

default
----

Installs/Configures common recipes

```json
"run_list": [
    "recipe[openstack-common]"
]
```

logging
----

Installs/Configures common logging

```json
"run_list": [
    "recipe[openstack-common::logging]"
]
```

set_endpoints_by_interface
----

Iterates over the contents of the `node['openstack']['endpoints']` hash and
finds any occurrence of `bind_interface` to set the IP address
(`node['openstack']['endpoints']['identity']['bind_interface'] = 'eth0'` for
example, overriding `node['openstack']['endpoints']['identity']['host']`). If
`bind_interface` isn't set, the value of `host` is not modified.

```json
"run_list": [
    "recipe[openstack-common::set_endpoints_by_interface]"
]
```

sysctl
----

Iterates over the contents of the `node['openstack']['sysctl']` hash and writes
the entries to `/etc/sysctl.d/60-openstack.conf`.

```json
"run_list": [
    "recipe[openstack-common::sysctl]"
]
```

Libraries
=========

This cookbook exposes a set of default library routines:

* `endpoint` -- Used to return a `::URI` object representing the named OpenStack endpoint
* `endpoints` -- Useful for operating on all OpenStack endpoints
* `db` -- Returns a Hash of information about a named OpenStack database
* `db_uri` -- Returns the SQLAlchemy RFC-1738 DB URI (see: http://rfc.net/rfc1738.html) for a named OpenStack database
* `db_create_with_user` -- Creates a database and database user for a named OpenStack database
* `secret` -- Returns the value of an encrypted data bag for a named OpenStack secret key and key-section
* `get_password` -- Ease-of-use helper that returns the decrypted password for a named database, service or keystone user.

Usage
-----

The following are code examples showing the above library routines in action.
Remember when using the library routines exposed by this library to include
the Openstack routines in your recipe's `::Chef::Recipe` namespace, like so:

```ruby
class ::Chef::Recipe
  include ::Openstack
end
```

Example of using the `endpoint` routine:

```ruby
nova_api_ep = endpoint "compute-api"
::Chef::Log.info("Using Openstack Compute API endpoint at #{nova_api_ep.to_s}")

# Note that endpoint URIs may contain variable interpolation markers such
# as `%(tenant_id)s`, so you may need to decode them. Do so like this:

require "uri"

puts ::URI.decode nova_api_ap.to_s
```

Example of using the `get_password` and `db_uri` routine:

```ruby
db_pass = get_password "db" "cinder"
db_user = node["cinder"]["db"]["user"]
sql_connection = db_uri "volume", db_user, db_pass

template "/etc/cinder/cinder.conf" do
  source "cinder.conf.erb"
  owner  node["cinder"]["user"]
  group  node["cinder"]["group"]
  mode   00644
  variables(
    "sql_connection" => sql_connection
  )
end
```

URI Operations
--------------

Use the `Openstack::uri_from_hash` routine to helpfully return a `::URI::Generic`
object for a hash that contains any of the following keys:

* `host`
* `uri`
* `port`
* `path`
* `scheme`

If the `uri` key is in the hash, that will be used as the URI, otherwise the URI will be
constructed from the various parts of the hash corresponding to the keys above.

```ruby
# Suppose node hash contains the following subhash in the :identity_service key:
# {
#   :host => 'identity.example.com',
#   :port => 5000,
#   :scheme => 'https'
# }
uri = ::Openstack::uri_from_hash(node[:identity_service])
# uri.to_s would == "https://identity.example.com:5000"
```

The routine will return nil if neither a `uri` or `host` key exists in the supplied hash.

Using the library without prefixing with ::Openstack
----------------------------------------------------

Don't like prefixing calls to the library's routines with `::Openstack`? Do this:

```ruby
class ::Chef::Recipe
  include ::Openstack
end
```

in your recipe.
