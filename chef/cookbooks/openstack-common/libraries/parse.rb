module ::Openstack

  # The current state of (at least some) OpenStack CLI tools do not provide a
  # mechanism for outputting data in formats other than PrettyTable output.
  # Therefore this function is intended to parse PrettyTable output into a
  # usable array of hashes. Similarly, it will flatten Property/Value tables
  # into a single element array.
  # table - the raw PrettyTable output of the CLI command
  # output - array of hashes representing the data.

    indicies = []

      unless line.start_with?('+--') or line.empty?

    # as Property Value pairs. If this is the case, then
    # flatten it as expected.
