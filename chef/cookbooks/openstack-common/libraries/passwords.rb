module ::Openstack
  # Library routine that returns an encrypted data bag value
  # for a supplied string. The key used in decrypting the
  # encrypted value should be located at
  # node["openstack"]["secret"]["key_path"].
  #
  # Note that if node["openstack"]["developer_mode"] is true,
  # then the value of the index parameter is just returned as-is. This
  # means that in developer mode, if a cookbook does this:
  #
  # class Chef
  #   class Recipe
  #     include ::Openstack
  #    end
  # end
  #
  # nova_password = secret "passwords", "nova"
  #
  # That means nova_password will == "nova".
